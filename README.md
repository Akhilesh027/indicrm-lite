- Role-based login system supporting **7 roles**: **Admin, Manager, Telecaller, Sales Executive, Employee, Accountant, Customer**.
- Each role gets a tailored sidebar with only authorized pages.
- Persistent session via Zustand `persist` middleware (`digitalness-crm-storage-v3`).
- Quick role-switch on login screen for demo/testing.

### 2. Dashboard
- Role-aware KPI stat cards (revenue, leads, customers, projects, pending invoices).
- **Revenue Chart** (Recharts) showing monthly trends.
- **Leads Funnel** visualization (New → In Progress → Converted → Lost).
- **Recent Activity** feed of latest leads, customers, and tasks.
- Framer Motion entry animations.

### 3. Branches Module
- Admin CRUD interface for managing **office branches** (seeded: Hyderabad — Main, Bangalore, Chennai).
- Fields: branch name, city, assigned manager (linked to employee), status (Active/Inactive).
- Branch IDs are referenced across Leads, Deals, Customers, Projects, Employees, and Invoices for branch-wise reporting.

### 4. Employee Management
- Full CRUD for employees (Admin/Manager only).
- Tracked fields: name, role, department, contact, email, joining date, salary, performance, **branchId**, **skills**, **reporting manager**, and **employeeType** (Full-Time, Part-Time, Freelance, Intern).
- Linked attendance and salary record stores.

### 5. Leads Management
- Add, edit, delete, filter, and search leads.
- **Statuses**: New, In Progress, Converted, Lost, Own Close.
- Extended fields: `branchId`, `budgetRange`, `leadScore` (Hot / Warm / Cold), `probability`, `nextFollowUpDate`, `inPipeline`.
- **Role-based assignment**: pick a role (Telecaller / Sales Executive / Employee), then choose from a filtered list.
- Inline reassignment by clicking the assignee in the table or via the row Actions menu.
- **Convert to Customer** in one click (auto-creates a customer record).
- **Add to Pipeline** action — promotes a lead into the Sales Pipeline as a Deal.
- Filters: status, branch, lead score, assignee.

### 6. Sales Pipeline (Kanban)
- Visual Kanban board with **8 stages**: New → Contacted → Qualified → Proposal Sent → Negotiation → Won → Lost.
- Drag deals between stages; deal cards show value, probability, branch, and owner.
- **Won automation**: marking a deal as Won automatically creates a `Customer`, a `Project`, and a `Draft Invoice`.
- **Lost automation**: requires a reason (Price, Competitor, Timing, Not interested, Other) for analytics.
- Deal store persisted independently (`dealStore.ts`).

### 7. Proposals Module
- Create branded proposals with dynamic service line items, quantities, rates, and auto-calculated totals.
- **Statuses**: Draft, Sent, Accepted, Rejected, Expired.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### State Management (Zustand + persist → localStorage)
- **`crmStore.ts`** — auth, employees, leads, customers, projects, attendance, salaries, financial records, **branches** (`digitalness-crm-storage-v4`).
- **`dealStore.ts`** — sales pipeline deals (Kanban).
- **`proposalStore.ts`** — proposals & their statuses.
- **`invoiceStore.ts`** — invoices, deliverables, payment records, payment reminders.
- **`templateStore.ts`** — project templates.
- **`ticketStore.ts`** — support tickets.
- **`taskStore.ts`** — agency tasks with SLA, work updates, playbooks (`digitalness-tasks-v1`).
- **`activityStore.ts`** — lead/deal/customer activity log (Call/Meeting/WhatsApp/Email/Note).
- **`communicationStore.ts`** — per-customer omnichannel timeline.
- **`approvalStore.ts`** — approval & revision lifecycle for any entity.
- **`expenseStore.ts`** — expense ledger with category & client attribution.
- **`notificationStore.ts`** — in-app role-scoped notification inbox.

Storage is versioned (`digitalness-crm-storage-v4`) so schema upgrades reseed cleanly.

### PDF Generation (`src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts`)

- Templates: **Client Report**, **Invoice**, **Proposal**, **Employee Report**.

### Design System
- Tailwind CSS with **HSL semantic tokens** in `index.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.
- shadcn/ui component library throughout (no raw color classes in components).
- Framer Motion for page transitions and micro-interactions.
- Lucide-react icons.

## 🔄 Cross-Module Automations

- **Lead → Pipeline**: "Add to Pipeline" creates a Deal in stage `New`.
- **Deal Won**: Auto-creates Customer + Project + Draft Invoice.
- **Deal Lost**: Requires reason capture (Price/Competitor/Timing/etc.).
- **Proposal Accepted**: Linked deal auto-advances to `Negotiation`.
- **Lead → Customer**: One-click conversion creates a Customer record and marks lead `Own Close`.
- **Project Template → Project**: Creating a project from a template seeds default deliverables, days, and cost.
